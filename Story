Once upon a time in a forest,there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree which 
was on the banks of a river.In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.The 
kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.The crocodil came back the next day fore
more fruits as days passed by,the crocodile and monkey became good friends.

One day the monkey send some fruits for the crocodile's wife.She ate the fruits and 
liked them but was jealous as her husband was spending time with the monkey.She told her 
husband if the fruits are so juicy I wonder how sweet the monkeys heart would be .
Get me the heart of the monkey.The crocodile was not willing to kill his friend but
had no choice.
